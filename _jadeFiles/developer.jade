    h2 What got me into development
    p I started coding at the early age of 7 with BASIC programming language, by the time I was 10, school has taken me onto a different path, but I always kept myself up to date with IT related technologies. Most of my life revolved and still revolves around IT, both personal and professional. 
    p In 2016 while working as a freelancer I decided to learn website development in my spare time. Shortly after the first course I've felt comfortable with coding, bringing back childhood nostalgia and made it very clear that this is what I want to do in the future.
