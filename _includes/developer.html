Most of my life revolved and still revolves around IT, both personal and professional. </p><p>In 2016 while working as a freelancer I decided to learn website development in my spare time. Shortly after the first course I've felt comfortable with coding, bringing back childhood nostalgia and made it very clear that this is what I want to do in the future.</p></section><section class="my-projects"><h2>Projects</h2><div class="projects"><div class="julia"><h3>Julia Marco Photography</h3><p>My first website</p></div><div class="we-can-work-it-hout"><h3>We can work it Hout</h3><p>First contract website for the ar<span>t</span>chitectural design company We Can Work It Hout</p></div></div></section><section class="technologies"><h2>Technologies and Tools</h2><p>I create static websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript</p><p>Libraries, frameworks and other tools make coding a pleasure</p><p>I feel comfortable with Jade/Pug, Sass, JQuery and Jekyll, amongst others</p></section><section class="my-code"><h2>Code</h2><p>I like to use Github for my projects, you can check my code at www.github.com/djeepgu</p></section><section class="goals"><h2>A look into the future</h2><p>Looking ahead I aim to become a full stack web developer, but also learn to create native applications for mobile platforms (iOS and Android)</p></section></div><div class="credits-popup"><a>Headshot by Julia Marco</a><br/><a href="http://gratisography.com/" target="_blank">Background image from Gratisography.com</a></div>
